                    CAR DEALER MANAGEMENT SAAS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CORE MISSION:
Enable car dealers (non-tech people) to launch a professional online 
presence and manage their business in minutes - no technical knowledge required.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PRODUCT VISION:
Multi-tenant SaaS where dealers get:
1. Professional branded website (auto-generated form tamplats)
2. Complete inventory management system
3. Customer inquiry/lead management
4. Their own custom domain (simplified setup)
5. Google Business integration (online visibility)
6.Mobile-friendly inquiry responses
7.Facebook Marketplace auto-posting


TARGET USER: 
Small to medium car dealers who are NOT tech-savvy. They need everything 
to "just work" without understanding hosting, DNS, databases, etc.

4-LAYER ARCHITECTURE:
├── Layer 1: Auth (Login/Register/Reset)
├── Layer 2: Setup (Business Info → Branding → Domain → Preview)
├── Layer 3: Dashboard (Inventory, Inquiries, Analytics, Settings)
└── Layer 4: Showroom (Public website - their custom domain)

MVP GOAL:
Dealer signs up → completes 4-step setup → has live website with custom 
domain → can add vehicles → customers can browse and inquire

SUCCESS METRICS:
- Setup completion time < 10 minutes
- Custom domain connected in < 5 minutes
- 90% of dealers successfully publish their site
- Zero technical support needed for basic setup

TECH CONSTRAINTS:
- Mobile responsive (many dealers use phones)
- Fast loading (customers expect speed)
- Secure (dealer data isolated via RLS)
- Scalable (1 to 10,000+ dealers)

WHEN WE GET OFF TRACK, ASK:
1. Does this help non-tech dealers get online faster?
2. Does this make their custom domain setup easier?
3. Is this essential for MVP or can it wait?
4. Does this complicate the simple setup flow?
