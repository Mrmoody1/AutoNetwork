## 📋 DECISION-MAKING FRAMEWORK

### Decision Matrix

| Decision Type | Who Decides | Your Role | My Role |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Business/Product** | YOU | Final decision | Suggest options |
| **Features Priority** | YOU | Final decision | Advise on effort |
| **UX/Design** | YOU | Final decision | Implement & suggest |
| **Technical Architecture** | ME | Review & approve | Decide & explain |
| **Technical Tradeoffs** | TOGETHER | Understand options | Explain clearly |

### Quick Decision Guide

**When I ask: "Should we add [feature]?"**
→ You decide: Yes/No/Later

**When I ask: "Should we use [Tech A] or [Tech B]?"**
→ I explain pros/cons, you approve my recommendation

**When you ask: "Can we make [thing] look like [this]?"**
→ I say yes and build it, or explain if it's problematic

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔄 SESSION STRUCTURE

### Every Development Session Follows This Pattern:

#### **1. Quick Recap (2-3 minutes)**
```
Last session: [what we completed]
Today's goal: [what we're building]
Current phase: Phase X
Progress: X% complete
```

#### **2. Check-In (2-3 minutes)**
```
Questions:
- Any thoughts from last time?
- Any changes to the plan?
- Any blockers or concerns?
```

#### **3. Build & Explain (Main Session)**
```
While building, I will:
- Explain what I'm doing and why
- Show code as I create it
- Check in at decision points
- Ask for your input when needed
- Keep you updated on progress
```

#### **4. Review & Iterate (As Needed)**
```
- You review what I built
- Provide feedback
- I make adjustments
- We confirm it's good
```

#### **5. Wrap Up (2-3 minutes)**
```
Summary:
- What we accomplished
- What's next
- Any action items
- Update PROJECT_STATE.md
```

## 📅 PHASE MANAGEMENT

### How We Move Through Phases

**START of Each Phase:**
1. I present: "Here's what Phase X includes"
2. You review and approve the plan
3. We agree on what "done" looks like

**DURING Each Phase:**
1. I build features one at a time
2. You ask questions anytime
3. I check in at key decision points
4. We test as we go

**END of Each Phase:**
1. I show you the complete phase
2. You test everything
3. We iterate on feedback
4. Mark phase complete ✅
5. Move to next phase

**RULE: No Going Backward**
- Once a phase is marked complete, we move forward
- Exception: Critical bugs only
- Minor tweaks go in "polish" phase later

---

## 🎨 DESIGN-FIRST APPROACH

### Before Building Any Page:

**Step 1: Reference Design System**
```
Check: DESIGN_SYSTEM.md
Confirm: Colors, spacing, typography
Verify: We're staying consistent
```

**Step 2: Quick Visual Plan**
```
I describe or sketch the layout
You approve or request changes
We agree on the look
```

**Step 3: Build**
```
I code the page using our design system
You review
We iterate if needed
```

**Step 4: Polish**
```
Final touches
Responsive testing
Mark as complete
```

### Design Consistency Rules

✅ **ALWAYS Use:**
- Colors from design system
- Typography scale from design system
- Spacing system (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, etc.)
- Component styles from design system

❌ **NEVER:**
- Create new colors randomly
- Use arbitrary spacing (like 13px or 27px)
- Ignore the design system
- Mix different design styles

---

## 💬 COMMUNICATION GUIDELINES

### How to Give Feedback

**Good Feedback (Be Specific):**
- ✅ "The login button doesn't work on mobile"
- ✅ "Can we make the car photos bigger on the inventory page?"
- ✅ "The filter should be more prominent"
- ✅ "This color doesn't match our brand"


**Rule:** If you can't describe what needs fixing, ask me to show you options.

### When You're Confused

**STOP ME IMMEDIATELY:**
```
"Wait, can you explain why we're doing this?"
"I'm lost, can you back up?"
"What does [term] mean?"
```

**I'll:**
- Slow down
- Explain in simpler terms
- Use analogies
- Show visual examples

### When I'm Confused

**I'll ask:**
```
"Just to confirm, you want [thing] to do [action]?"
"Can you show me an example of what you mean?"
"Is this what you're envisioning?"
```

**You:**
- Clarify your vision
- Show examples if helpful
- Describe the end result you want

---

## 🚫 SCOPE CONTROL (CRITICAL)

### The Biggest Risk: Scope Creep

**Signs We're Off Track:**
- 🚨 Talking about features not in current phase
- 🚨 Saying "oh we should also add..."
- 🚨 Spending hours debating minor details
- 🚨 Building things "just in case"
- 🚨 Adding "one more thing" repeatedly

### The "Parking Lot" Method

**When a Good Idea Comes Up:**
```
Step 1: Write it down in PROJECT_STATE.md "Parking Lot" section
Step 2: Continue with current phase
Step 3: Review parking lot before starting next phase
Step 4: Decide if it's worth adding then
```

**Examples:**
```
Current Phase: Building login page
Idea: "We should add SMS login!"
Action: Parking lot → Phase 2 feature

Current Phase: Adding inventory management
Idea: "Can we auto-post to Facebook?"
Action: Parking lot → Phase 3 integration

Current Phase: Creating dashboard
Idea: "What if we add dark mode?"
Action: Parking lot → Post-MVP polish
```

### The "MVP Filter"

**Before Adding ANYTHING, Ask:**
```
Question: "Does a dealer NEED this to sell a car online?"

If YES:
→ Consider for current phase

If NO:
→ Parking lot for later

If MAYBE:
→ Discuss if it solves a major pain point
```

**Examples:**
```
"Add vehicle photos" → YES (need this NOW)
"Auto-enhance photos with AI" → NO (nice to have, later)
"Show vehicle pricing" → YES (need this NOW)
"Calculate loan payments" → MAYBE (discuss: solve pain point?)
```

---

## 🧪 TESTING & FEEDBACK CYCLE

### When I Share Code

**What You Should Look For:**
- ✅ Does it match what we discussed?
- ✅ Is the UI intuitive?
- ✅ Are there obvious bugs?
- ✅ Does it work on mobile?
- ✅ Is it consistent with design system?

**What You DON'T Need to Worry About:**
- ❌ Code quality/syntax
- ❌ Performance (unless obviously slow)
- ❌ Edge cases (we'll handle later)
- ❌ Pixel-perfect alignment (for MVP)

### Feedback Priority

**Phase 1-12 (MVP):**
```
Priority 1: Does it work? (functionality)
Priority 2: Is it usable? (UX)
Priority 3: Does it look decent? (UI)
Priority 4: Is it pixel-perfect? (polish) ← SKIP for MVP
```

**Phase 13-15 (Polish):**
```
Now we care about:
- Pixel-perfect design
- Smooth animations
- Perfect responsive design
- Accessibility
- Performance optimization
```

### Rule: Function > Form (For Now)

**MVP Mantra:**
- "Good enough" is perfect
- Ship first, polish later
- Working beats beautiful
- Progress over perfection

---

## 📂 CODE ORGANIZATION

### How We Share Code

**During Sessions:**
```
I create code in artifacts (small chunks)
You copy from artifacts into your project
You test locally
You report any issues
I fix and we continue
```

**Between Sessions:**
```
You commit to GitHub
You update PROJECT_STATE.md
You push changes
Next session, I read from GitHub
We continue exactly where we left off
```

### File Naming Conventions

**Components:**
```
PascalCase: LoginForm.tsx, VehicleCard.tsx
Location: /src/components/[feature]/
```

**Pages:**
```
lowercase: login/page.tsx, inventory/page.tsx
Location: /src/app/[route]/
```

**Utilities:**
```
camelCase: formatDate.ts, validateEmail.ts
Location: /src/lib/utils/
```

**Types:**
```
PascalCase: User.ts, Vehicle.ts
Location: /src/types/
```

---

## 🔄 GIT WORKFLOW

### Commit Message Format

**Structure:**
```
Phase [X]: [Action] [Feature/Component]

Examples:
"Phase 1: Add login form validation"
"Phase 2: Create vehicle card component"
"Phase 0: Update project state"
"Fix: Resolve mobile menu bug"
```

### Commit Frequency

**Commit When:**
- ✅ Complete a feature/component
- ✅ End of session
- ✅ Before major changes
- ✅ After fixing a bug

**Don't Commit:**
- ❌ Broken/non-working code
- ❌ Work-in-progress (unless end of session)
- ❌ Experimental code that doesn't work

### Branch Strategy (Simple)

```
main (stable, working code)
├── We commit directly to main
└── Why: Solo developer, simpler workflow
```

**If we need feature branches later:**
```
main
├── feature/phase-5-onboarding
└── feature/phase-9-dashboard
```

---

## 🎯 PRIORITY SYSTEM

### How to Handle Multiple Issues

**When You Have Multiple Feedback Items:**

**Priority 1: Blockers** 🔴
```
What: Something completely broken
Example: "Can't login at all"
Action: Fix immediately
```

**Priority 2: Major Issues** 🟡
```
What: Important feature not working correctly
Example: "Photos not uploading"
Action: Fix before moving on
```

**Priority 3: Minor Issues** 🟢
```
What: Small bugs or improvements
Example: "Button text is slightly off-center"
Action: Note it, fix in polish phase
```

**Priority 4: Nice-to-Haves** ⚪
```
What: Optional enhancements
Example: "Add a subtle animation"
Action: Parking lot for later
```

### When to Stop and Fix

**Fix Now:**
- Anything that prevents using the feature
- Security issues
- Data loss issues
- Major UX problems

**Fix Later:**
- Visual polish
- Edge cases
- Performance optimization
- Nice-to-have features

---

## 🚀 MOMENTUM MAINTENANCE

### How to Keep Moving Fast

**DO:**
- ✅ Make quick decisions
- ✅ Embrace "good enough for MVP"
- ✅ Trust each other's expertise
- ✅ Stay focused on current phase
- ✅ Update PROJECT_STATE.md every session
- ✅ Celebrate small wins
- ✅ Ship features frequently

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Overthink decisions
- ❌ Pursue perfection early
- ❌ Question every technical choice
- ❌ Jump between phases
- ❌ Forget to document progress
- ❌ Wait for "ready" - start building
- ❌ Get stuck in planning

### The "Two Day Rule"

**If stuck on a decision for more than 2 days:**
```
Step 1: Pick the simpler option
Step 2: Build it
Step 3: Learn from it
Step 4: Adjust if needed
```

**Why:** Building teaches more than planning.

---

## 🗣️ LANGUAGE & COMMUNICATION

### Technical Terms I'll Explain

When I use these terms, I'll explain in plain English:
- **Component** = Reusable piece of UI (like a button)
- **API** = Way for frontend to talk to backend
- **State** = Data that changes (like form inputs)
- **Props** = Data passed to components
- **Hook** = Special React function
- **Route** = A page URL (like /login or /dashboard)

### Terms You Can Use

Feel free to use these:
- "Page" instead of "route" or "component"
- "Button" instead of "CTA" or "action"
- "Box" instead of "container" or "div"
- "List" instead of "array" or "map"
- Whatever makes sense to you!

**Rule:** I adapt to your language, not vice versa.

## 🎯 BEFORE ASKING, CHECK DOCS FIRST

**This Saves Time:**

**Instead of:**
```
You: "What color should the button be?"
Me: *explains colors*
```

**Do this:**
```
You: *checks DESIGN_SYSTEM.md*
You: "Using primary blue #3B82F6 for button"
Me: "Perfect! ✅"
```

**Instead of:**
```
You: "What phase are we on?"
Me: *looks it up*
```

**Do this:**
```
You: *checks PROJECT_STATE.md*
You: "We're on Phase 1, 60% complete"
Me: "Correct! Let's continue..."
```

**When to Still Ask:**
- ❓ Can't find answer in docs
- ❓ Docs conflict with each other
- ❓ Need clarification on doc content
- ❓ Docs are outdated
- ❓ New situation not covered in docs

**Rule:** Docs are source of truth, but always ask if unsure!
